User roles
==========

There are some different user roles that all have there own user stories, these are the roles I have identified up till now.

Player
------

A player is a member of a sportsteam with a sportsclub. He joins activities (like training, matches etc.) on a more or less regular bases. A player might have some special selection criteria that limits what he can do in a team (only starboard rower, only steering mate, and such more).

Captain
-------

Every sportsteam within a sportsclub has one or more team captains. The team captain makes sure that there are enough players on an activity, so that the activity can continue. He tries to find more people if there are not enough members and coordinates that everyone has there place within the team.

Master
------

The club master is responsible for onboarding and ofboarding players and (re-)assigning them to a team. He plans which teams will use the facilties (boats) on which timeslot.

Admin
-----

the admin creates new clubs with the correct resources for that club.
