title: "Diving deep"

Currently I am preparing everything to start the live coding session. It's always a hustle to get started with a new project. You want to dive into the coding and your ideas as quickly as possible, but there is a lot to setup before you can start.

Luckily I have already a lot running, I do not have to think about the [IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I want to use, and my head is already spinning with ideas about the design and the languages I want to use. But first:

* I need a website (look where you are reading this blog post!),
* I need to setup my twitch account to stream and do a try out,
* Deploying, using the CI/CD stuff as a pro devops, and
* I need to write down the essential user stories.

Some of these things might sound a bit far fetched, and only something that a professional development team needs. But I learned the hard way that if you want to deliver a complex project, that you need to structure the information and what you want to deliver upfront. If you don't, at least if __I__ don't, I will definately get lost in the details and spending way to much time on a trivial part of the software, without finishing.

Well, finishing, that's a difficult term. What I mean is to have a deliverable product. Probably with lots of additional feature requests (most of them probably from myself), but something that's workable. That can handle the user stories that we're first drawn up.

It - almost - happend to me on day one of this project. I needed a website to share my user stories and tell people what I am trying to accomplish here. I like to have a central [github](https://github.com/martijnburger/teamplanner) repository for my code, so it makes sense to have the website on there too. Github has a relatively new feature called github pages with which you can publish a website. Activate gh-pages and done, you would say. But, hey, that doesn't look very appealing, let's add one of the standard teams that are available on github. As it seems none of these themes have a top menu (I seriously doubt that's true now), and I ~~want~~ need a topmenu.

So there we go. To create a local theme I need ruby / jekyll, both of which I have never used before. Lot's of themes available, but how to get them to work in github? Solved that, now adding the menu's, first content and - of course - the all important color changes and font selection. Pfew. A full day has gone by, and I am writing my first article content right now!

Now I really have to start writing the user stories.
