Concept
=======
The teamplanner application is created as an open source application. It can be used by everyone, under the GPLv3 open source license.

The project is started by [Martijn Burger](https://linkedin.com/in/brgrm) for his rowing club. The sports planning application currently available where not easy to use and lacked functionality.

Please note the [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) we are using.
