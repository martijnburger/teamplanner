Concept
=======

Teamplanner is an application that helps sporting clubs with multiple teams plan there activities. We are trying to use modern technologies to develop. It is based on a real world problem with a sloop rowing club in the Netherlands. The application is started by [Martijn Burger](https://linkedin.com/in/brgrm), a member of this club.

Method
------

Of course we are using CI/CD for the project and we're running microservices on kubernetes. But if you're like me, you rather see that working than read about it. So I tried to create some basic user stories to kick off the project, and make sure that everyone can follow what I am doing. That way I hope to get some exposure for this project, as well as help and hints from other programmers. The project is open source, available on [github](https://github.com/martijnburger) and live coded on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/martijnburger).

About Roeiploeg Utrecht
-----------------------

Remember the ending of the movie Titanic? Remember the sloops that people were trying to get away in? Three of these sloops are owned by the rowing club [Roeiploeg Utrecht](https://roeiploegutrecht.nl){:target="_blank"}. The sloops are located in the beautiful dutch city of Utrecht, and are used for matches all over the Netherlands and sometimes even at the large matches in other European cities, like the Great River Race in London or the Vogalonga in Italy.

About Martijn
-------------

I started as a project manager at the dutch telecommunications company. There I did some complex software development projects. After that I started my own [company](https://paston.nl){:target="_blank"} where we develop a software solution for the insurance industry. The first versions of this solution I created myself, and I loved it, coding for 60 - 80 hours a week. But as the application grow, so did the demands, after hiring some external programmers to help me out I decided to outsource the entire development. Currently the development of the insurance solution is done at our Bulgarian [partner](https://dreamix.eu){:target="_blank"}. That means that my work is mainly on 'the dark side' now. Communication between customers and developers, marketing and sales. It's a very satisfying job, with an amazing team and great customers, but I do miss the actual coding. That's probably the single most important reason I am starting this project.
